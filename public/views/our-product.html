<h1>What We Solve</h1>

<h3>We allow you to monitor your garden grow levels with various sensors.</h3>

<p>Humans have been growing food for 10,000 years. Agriculture is in our genes. We all have an inner farmer, a need and desire to connect with the soil and grow the food we eat. All we have to do is nurture that desire, and feed the inner farmer!</p>
