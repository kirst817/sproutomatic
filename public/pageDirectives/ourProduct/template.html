<h2>We monitor your garden's grow levels with sensors.</h2>


<h3>It's as simple as adding the pre-packaged sensors to your garden.</h3>

  <li>Humidity</li>
  <li>Temperature</li>
</ul> -->

  <p>Humans have been growing food for over 10,000 years. We have a need and desire to connect with the soil and grow the food we eat. All we have to do is nurture that desire, and feed our inner farmer! Sproutomatic only makes the process easier.
